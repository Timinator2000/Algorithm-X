# Solver Translations

On the following pages are various language translations of the provided [`AlgorithmXSolver`](../03-AlgorithmXSolver/01-the-AlgorithmXSolver.md#using-the-algorithmxsolver-class). I am not the author of any of these translations. CodinGamers with significantly more language expertise than me have taken on the task of writing these translations and sharing their code. I owe each of them a debt of gratitude.

# Quality Guarantee

For each translation, either the author or I have completed several puzzles using the translation and feel confident in the functionality. I spent two years working with and refining my Python solver. Obviously, we canâ€™t do that with each translation. However, I will make this pseudo guarantee:

__If you run into issues with any of these translations, post a note in the [CodinGame Forum's Algorithm X / DLX Thread](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/puzzles-solvable-by-algorithm-x-dancing-links/196871/14) and I feel confident the CodinGame community will do their best to get you the help you need.__
