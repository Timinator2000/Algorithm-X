# Solver Translations

On the following pages are various language translations of the provided [`AlgorithmXSolver`](../03-AlgorithmXSolver/01-the-AlgorithmXSolver.md#using-the-algorithmxsolver-class). In several cases, CodinGamers with significantly more language expertise than me have taken on the task of writing a translation and sharing their code. I owe each of them a debt of gratitude.

# ✅ Contributor Note — Future Translations

If you are planning to translate `AlgorithmXSolver` to another language, it is recommended that you review and base your work on the [C++](../23-solver-translations/05-cpp.md) implementation rather than the original Python version.

The original Python solver makes use of several Python-specific language features and reflects an earlier stage of the design. The C++ translation is more explicit about ownership, lifetimes, constraints, and performance considerations, and generally provides a clearer picture of the intended architecture.

For these reasons, the C++ version is a better reference when designing future translations.

# Quality Guarantee

For each translation, either the author or I have completed several puzzles using the translation and feel confident in the functionality. I spent two years working with and refining my Python solver. Obviously, we can’t do that with each translation. However, I will make this pseudo guarantee:

__If you run into issues with any of these translations, post a note in the [CodinGame Forum's Algorithm X / DLX Thread](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/puzzles-solvable-by-algorithm-x-dancing-links/196871/14) and I feel confident the CodinGame community will do their best to get you the help you need.__
