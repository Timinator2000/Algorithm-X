# Final Exam Exercises

Each puzzle in this section was chosen because it can be expressed as an exact cover problem, and the Algorithm X setup is straightforward. These puzzles will test your understanding of Algorithm X without requiring any problem-space reduction or complex action enumeration strategies.

After finishing each one, take a moment to review only the code you wrote. Reflect on the time and effort it took to pass all test cases. When you consider the `AlgorithmXSolver` code you had to include in your source file, your solution might feel like “overkill.” But imagine if that solver came from a library you simply imported — would it feel the same? You might instead appreciate how much Algorithm X streamlined the process and how powerful it is to have a reusable architecture that handles a wide range of structurally similar problems once the details are abstracted away.

Good luck — and enjoy the elegance of Algorithm X!
