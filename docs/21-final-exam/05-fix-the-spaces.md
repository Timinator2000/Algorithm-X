# Overview

Two years passed between my original solution to this puzzle and my new approach using Algorithm X. My memory may not be as sharp as it once was, but I clearly remember enjoying the challenge. Looking back at that old code, it’s obvious I poured a lot of thought into logically narrowing down possibilities to reach a solution. With a little review, I’m confident I could still follow what it’s doing.

In contrast, it took me only a few minutes to construct an exact cover solution with Algorithm X. It looks like so many other solutions I’ve built since. The joy this time isn’t in the grind — it’s in the grace. There’s real satisfaction in watching a medium-difficulty puzzle fall quickly and elegantly. It feels like playing 2-on-2 basketball with a 7-foot-3 teammate who dunks every pass I toss.
